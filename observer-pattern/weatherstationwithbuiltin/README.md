## The Observer Pattern

Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and update automatically.

## Design Principles

* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

## Implementation
In this case we use the java's built-in observer pattern. For that we use the interface **Observer** and the class **Observable**
