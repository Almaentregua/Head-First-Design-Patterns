## The Observer Pattern

Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and update automatically.

## Design Principles

* Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
* Program to an interface, not an implementation.
* Favor composition over inheritance.
* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
