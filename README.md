# Head First Design Patterns
I am using this repo to save my notes and progress of the book "Head First Design Patterns: A Brain-Friendly Guide" By Eric Freeman, Elisabeth Robson, Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates.
Book material: https://www.wickedlysmart.com/head-first-design-patterns/

## The Strategy Pattern

Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## The Observer Pattern

Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and update automatically.

## Design Principles

* Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.

* Program to an interface, not an implementation.

* Favor composition over inheritance.

* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

* Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
